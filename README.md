App Name: CodeMart.io

Description:

🛍️ CodeMart — A Play Store-like Web App

CodeMart is a cool Play Store–inspired web app built with React JS and Tailwind CSS. Users can explore different apps, check details, and install or uninstall them — all managed using localStorage. I used React Router DOM for smooth page navigation and SweetAlert2 for nice confirmation pop-ups. The app also includes a live search, sorting options, and a simple loading animation for better UX. All app data comes from a local JSON file, making it super easy to manage. It’s fully responsive, clean, and built just for fun and practice 🚀
